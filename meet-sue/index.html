				<p class="intro">A different approach to dog grooming...</p>

				<p>Sue is an experienced dog owner and groomer in Nottingham who's putting animal care and service first.</p>

				<p>Many dog owners report a less-than-satisfactory service from their current dog groomer or chain pet shop. Sue looks to offer something missing from the business of dog grooming; personal service, informed advice <em>from experience</em>, and an authentic care for your dog that's clear to see. Sue aims to provide an experience that both you and your dog will love, and a cut to your requirements.</p>

				<p>A mother of four children, as well as being a long-time animal lover and dog owner of 30 years, Sue holds a degree in Science and a City &amp; Guilds qualificaion in Dog Grooming backed up with years of experience grooming (and owning!) many types of dogs.</p>
